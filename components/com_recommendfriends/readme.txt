Program Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

D-Mack RecommendFriends Version v2.0.3 - January-06-2009 is a component to allow your users to recommend your website to their friends.

It can send multiple emails, number defined in Admin, with the friends name, and copy the Administrator and/or the User.  It also incorporates Captcha Security to help prevent spam and the option to send Content-Type:text/html MIME format!  ALL text for the entire component, front end and back, can be edited on-line in the Admin area of the site.  And the component is XHTML 1.0 Transitional valid!

This component uses standard Joomla! <b>JFactory Mailer</b> functions - which should work if your website's email settings are correctly configured for your website server (i.e. Sendmail, PHPMailer, SMTP, etc).

Program Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of this version (RecommendFriends v2.0.3 - January-06-2009) there are many great configuration settings for the component.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Administrator can set how many 'Email Fields' are displayed on the Front End.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to select how the 'From' and 'Reply To' addresses are set. If selected (checked), the 'From' and 'Reply To' email addresses in the email sent to the Friend(s) will be set to the User. If NOT selected, the 'From' email address will be set with the site 'Administrator' email address and the 'Reply To' email address will be set with the User's email address.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to set whether the site Administrator should receive a copy (Bcc) of every email sent to the user's 'Friends'. If you have a large, active site with many users, you may want to disable this option as you possibly could receive many emails. If selected (checked), the Admin email will be set in the Bcc field so it will not be visible to most users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can change or customize the 'Subject' field for the emails. There is a checkbox that determines whether to use the custom subject field or not. Unfortunately you are not able to use custom tags or formatting at this time. It should be text only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can also set a customized introduction message for the emails sent to Friends. There is also a checkbox for this that will enable/disable the use of the introduction message. This can be a great way to get more members for your site. You could list the features and benefits of your site that will hopefully entice friends to join. If you have a 'Referral' program setup, this would be a great place to describe how it works, what the benefits are for a new member and explain the benefits for the User who sent the RecommendFriends emails.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is also and option to allow/enable HTML code to be entered in the custom introduction.  Enabling the option will send all the Emails as Content-Type:text/html MIME format.  You can use any HTML code in the message, but you can NOT use any other codes (PHP, Javascript, etc.) in the custom field.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There many ways to change the appearance of the form fields in the front end - now including the form field widths! Using custom color selectors, you can change the form field backkground and text colors, the form field validation alert background and text colors as well as the background and text colors that display the username and email address for logged in users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RecommendFriends v2.0.3 - January-06-2009 also includes Captcha Security! *NOTE* Your website server *MUST* have GD Library enabled as well as True Type Fonts!  You can choose if you want use it or not, as well as set many variables for the image including the width, height, text rotation, set all colors (background-text-noise) by using custom color selectors, choose the font type and set the number of characters displayed in the image.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** ALL ** text that is displayed on screen for this component, including the front end, admin configuration text and what you are reading now, is called through the included language file(s) in the includes folder - and now it can all be edited ** ON-LINE ** through the component! Feel free to change the text any way you like. If you have translated the text into a different language (other than English), please contact me so I can include your Language file into the component distribution! Thanks!
